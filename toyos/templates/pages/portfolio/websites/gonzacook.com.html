<h1>gonzacook.com</h1>
<p> 
    A website for a small cooking business. <a href="https://gonzacook.com">gonzacook.com</a> features a catalog of food products and a virtual kart for taking orders.
    The website is dynamically generated using <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">Flask</a> framework and it's hosted on a <a href="https://github.com/Pylons/waitress">Waitress</a> server over a <a href="https://nginx.org/">Nginx</a> reverse proxy. The website is mobile-first oriented and relies on
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for it's responsive components. 
<p>
<p>
    The original website was made using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Server_Pages">JSP</a>, but it was migrated to Flask on October 2022 because it proved to have faster responses,
    more efficient deployment cycle, and it was easier to add new content to the website.
</p>
<p>
    Despite using Flask, the core logic of the shopping kart is fully implemented in javascript, making the site interaction (cliking buttons, confirming forms, etc.) a seamless
    experience. Flask is used as a way of assembling the website templates and fast deployment.

    If you are not at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo">Montevideo</a> I'm afraid they wouldnt be able to take your order. Nevertheless, feel free to <a href="https://gonzacook.com">take a peek</a>
    or see it's source code <a href="https://github.com/Gtoyos/GonzaCook">on github</a>.
