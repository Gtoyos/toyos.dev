                <h1>About Toyos.dev</h1>
                <p> 
                    This website has two purposes. First of all, is a mean of advertising myself, so people can get to know about what I love to work on. 
                    It's a way of quickly introducing myself, if you want to know about me you just have to visit <a href="/" class="yh">toyos.dev</a>,
                    you can take a look at my projects with a few clicks. Additionally, I have authentic control of how I wish to convey my work and transmit
                    the right professional image of my work. I hope the simplicity of this website enchances the content of my projects. 

                <p>
                    On the other hand, this site is a little counter-movement against the mainstream web, which is centered around a few dozens websites administrated
                    by big corporations. Having a personal website is like owning a little bastion of freedom to express oneself. More than ever we have the means to actively be part
                    of the Web, and I hope I'm doing my part by publishing this website for all internauts to discover. It's up to us to make The World Wide Web a marvellous place.
