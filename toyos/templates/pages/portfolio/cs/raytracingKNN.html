<h1>Using Ray Tracing cores for accelerating a KNN algorithm.</h1>
<p> 
    This project studies the use of ray tracing cores - a novel type of GPU hardware used for accelerating ray tracing algorithms - for accelerating a k-nearest neighbours algorithm.
    Final project of GPGPU - General purpose computing in GPUs at <a href="https://www.fing.edu.uy/">Universidad de la Rep√∫blica (UDELAR)</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The aim of this project was to do a research of the state of the art in using ray tracing cores - introduced in Nvidia <a href="https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/en-zz/Solutions/design-visualization/technologies/turing-architecture/NVIDIA-Turing-Architecture-Whitepaper.pdf"> Turing architecture</a> - for general purpose computing.
    Specifically, we studied the use of this new hardware for accelerating the KNN algorithm. This involved the analysis of how the original problem of the K nearest neighbours can be reformulated to a ray tracing problem.
</p>
<p>
    Below you can find a report about the algorithm (Explanation, experimental analysis and performance reports) and its source code. Unfortunately, the report is only available in Spanish.
    The appendix section contains a detailed explanation of how to use the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing/optix">OptiX library</a> for building a KNN algorithm that benefits from the ray tracing cores.
